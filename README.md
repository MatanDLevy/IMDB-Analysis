# Project Title: IMDB Analysis 

## Overview
This project is a data analysis of a couple IMDB datasets, using PySpark, and AWS’s EMR Notebook capabilities. The project’s purpose is to derive observations from the datasets.

## Dependencies
- Jupyter Notebook
- PySpark
- AWS EMR Notebook
- Python 3.7
- Pandas 1.0.3
- Matplotlib 3.2.1

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Create an AWS EMR Cluster according to EMR cluster configuration in the image below. 
3. Navigate to the AWS EMR Notebooks section and create a new notebook. Associate it with the cluster you just created.
4. Once the notebook is open, change the kernel to PySpark.
5. Upload the notebook to the Jupyter notebook home menu, and then open it. 
6. You can now interact with the notebook, running the code cells and modifying them as needed.
